# burger--Node Express Handlebars

Eat Da Burger!

Overview:

Created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!)



* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured, under 'Burgers Available'

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page, under 'Burger's Eatten'.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.



 **This assignment must be deployed.** * Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
